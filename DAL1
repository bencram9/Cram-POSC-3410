# Lesson 2 ####
# Let's Try Some Basic Arithmetic ####
# Sum of 1 and 1
1+1
# Divide 365 by 12
365/12
# Your turn, multiply 10 by 12
10*12
# Your turn, add 28 + 38
28+38
# Order of Operations in R
1+1*(365/12)

#Learning to assign variables ####
#Run this line of code to assign your first variable.
myFirstVar<- "Hello world!"

#Run myFirstVar in the console.
myFirstVar

#Code a second variable with a number.
mySecondVar<-16

#Run mySecondVar in the console.
mySecondVar

#Now let's practice assigning variables.
#Assign "Clemson" to 'home'
home<-"Clemson"

#Assign "Tigers: to 'h_mascot'
h_mascot<-"Tigers"

#Assign "Ohio State" to 'away'
away<-"Ohio State"

#Assign 'Buckeyes' to 'a_mascot'
a_mascot<-"Buckeyes"

#Assign 31 to 'homeScore'
homeScore<-31

#Assign 0 to 'awayScore'
awayScore<-0

#Assign True to homeWin
homeWin<-TRUE

#Assign FALSE to awayWin
awaywin<-FALSE

#Use class to identify the data type for the following variables
class(h_mascot)
class(homeScore)
class(homeWin)

#Use str to identify the data types for the following variables
str(h_mascot)
str(homeScore)
str(homeWin)

#Can sports scores ever be represented as decimals? No. We need to convert the 'homeScore' and 'awayScore'
#Convert 'homeScore' to integer and assign to same var name.
homeScore <- as.integer(homeScore)
homeScore

#Now it is your turn.
#Convert 'awayScore' to integer and assign to same var name.
awayScore <- as.integer(awayScore)
awayScore

#Make a numeric vector by using the syntax 'c(#,#,#,#)'; check its structure.
vector_numeric <- c(12, 8, 16, 4, 15)
str(vector_numeric)

#Make a numeric vector, 'myNumericVector', on your own; check its structure
myNumericVector <- c(23, 14, 17, 2, 9, 3)
str(myNumericVector)

#Make a logical vector; check its structure.
vector_logical <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
str(vector_logical)

#Make a logical vector, 'myLogicalVector' on your own; check its structure.
myLogicalvector <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
str(myLogicalvector)

#Make a character vector; check its structure.
vector_character <- c("Montana", "Aikman", "Manning", "Favre", "Mahomes")
str(vector_character)

#Make a character vector, 'myCharVector' on your own; check its structure.
myCharVector <- c("Gabbert", "Leaf", "Manziel", "Russell", "Carr", "Peterman")
str(myCharVector)

#Make a list of vectors that I created: drAllardList; check its structure.
drAllardList <- list(vector_numeric, vector_logical, vector_character)
str(drAllardList)

#Notice a few things about the list: (1) A list is made up of vectors with different types, (2) etc.

#Make a list of the vectors YOU created: myList; check its structure.
myList <- list(myNumericVector, myLogicalvector, myCharVector)
str(myList)

#Create data frame: QB_df; print in console; check structure
QB_df <- data.frame(vector_character, vector_numeric, vector_logical)
QB_df
str(QB_df)
#Note: It is a good practice to add '_df' to the names of objects that are data frames.

#print the numeric column to the console; use syntax: dataframe$columnName
QB_df$vector_numeric

#Rename QB_df$vector_character as QB_df$qbName
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_character"] <- "qbName"

str(QB_df)

#What is going on here?
We changed the name of one of the data frame columns

#Select the first row of QB_df
QB_df[1,]

#Select the first column of QB_df
QB_df[,1]

#Select the 'qbName' column using ""
QB_df[,"qbName"]

#If you want to keep the complexity of the data frame, you can use the following formats
QB_df[1]

QB_df["qbName"]

#It is important to know the difference between these approaches because we will use each for different etc.

#Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 3rd row and 2nd column
QB_df[3,2]

#Now it is your turn.
My_df <-data.frame(myCharVector, myNumericVector, myLogicalvector)
My_df
str(My_df)
My_df$myNumericVector
My_df$myCharVector
names(My_df)[names(My_df)=="myCharVector"] <- "myqbName"
str(My_df)

# Select the first row of your dataframe
My_df[1,]

# Select the 3rd column of your dataframe
My_df[,3]

#Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 1st row and 2nd column of your data frame
My_df [1,2]

#What type of data structure is returned by calling names(QB_df)?
names(QB_df)

## [1] "qbName"         "vector_numeric" "vector_logical"
#Answer: a vector

#If we want to rename a specific element of the vector, then we need to use indexing to select etc.
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"]

##[1] "vector_numeric
#Now we need to assign a new value to it.
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"]<- "jerseyNum"

#Repeat this process for the 3rd column: HoFer (Hall of Famer)
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_logical"]
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_logical"] <- "HoFer"
