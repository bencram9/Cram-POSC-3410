# Purpose: Learn how to do chi-sq. test

# Data

# Script ####
# Theory: Support of science and technology ==> Views on space exploration
# H0: A person's views on science and technology gives more opportunities to the next generation (nextgen) are NOT related to their views on supporting space exploration (intspace).
# H1: A person's views on science and technology gives more opportunities to the next generation (nextgen) are related to their views on supporting space exploration (intspace)

# Statistical Tests
# nextgen = IV = categorical variable, non-interval - 2 independent groups (agree and disagree) non-ordinal = who fits into these groups <- This will require some work.

# intspace = DV = categorical variable, non-interval = 2 or more categories


# Get data in shape for analysis ####

# What do you think we will have to do to the rows? To the columns?

# Do we want something that looks roughly like this?
